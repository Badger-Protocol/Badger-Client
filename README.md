## Overview

Welcome to **Badger**, the no-code platform designed to simplify the deployment and interaction with smart contracts on the EVM compatible blockchains. Our intuitive interface and powerful backend ensure that you can focus on what truly matters - bringing your blockchain ideas to life.

## Features

- **Creation**: Users can create FTs and NFTs by interacting with a user-friendly interface.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Fully compatible with any EVM-based blockchain.
- **EIP Standard**: Tokens follows the Ethereum Standard.
- **Interactivity**: Interact with deployed contracts with ease, thanks to our built-in tools.

## Tools

- [**_NextJs_**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**_Foundry_**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
- [**_TypeScript_**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [**_Solidity_**](https://soliditylang.org/)

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users use their wallet to connect to the platform.
2. **Contract Configuration**: Users select the type of contract they wish to create and configure its properties.
3. **Deployment**: The contracts are deployed to the Core Blockchain.
4. **Management**: Users can manage their tokens within the platform.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get a development environment running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhantomOz/Badger-
cd badger
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Future plans

As we move on from the hackathon we plan to add more functionalities like:

- The ability for users to add liquidity in the FT's they have created.
- The ability for users to create `staking` contract, `Exchange` contract and more.
- Badger Sdk for developers to create and build, deploy smart contract on Core Blockchain using languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.

We believe that this tool will be great for onboarding more users to the Core Blockchain.
